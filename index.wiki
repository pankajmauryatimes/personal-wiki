My name is *Zongheng Yang*, a high school senior in [http://www.shenzhong.net Shenzhen Middle School], Shenzhen, China ([http://maps.google.com/maps?q=shenzhen,+china&hl=en&client=firefox-a&gl=us&z=10&vpsrc=0 Google Maps]).

This personal Wiki is constructed and maintained with [http://www.vim.org/ Vim] + [http://code.google.com/p/vimwiki/ Vimwiki], which mean I can add something to my personal knowledge base within no more than 10 additional keystrokes, and yes, no mouse needed.

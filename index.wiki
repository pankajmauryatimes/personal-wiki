``The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.''

My name is *Zongheng Yang*, a high school senior in [http://www.shenzhong.net Shenzhen Middle School], Shenzhen, China ([http://maps.google.com/maps?q=shenzhen,+china&hl=en&client=firefox-a&gl=us&z=10&vpsrc=0 Google Maps]). My usual nickname on the Web is *Covi*. If you need to contact me, my email is near the end of this page.

This personal Wiki is constructed and maintained with [http://www.vim.org/ Vim] + [http://code.google.com/p/vimwiki/ Vimwiki] + [http://git-scm.com Git] and several other tools, which enable me to add something to my personal knowledge base within no more than 10 manipulative keystrokes, and yes, no mouse needed!

The Wiki records various aspects of my life and presents some of my interests.

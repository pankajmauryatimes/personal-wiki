Hi and _Willkommen_! My name is *Zongheng Yang*, a [[http://www.shenzhong.net|Shenzhen Middle School]] ([[http://maps.google.com/maps?q=shenzhen,+china&hl=en&client=firefox-a&gl=us&z=10&vpsrc=0|Google Maps: Shenzhen, China]]) '12 alumni, and [[http://berkeley.edu|UC Berkeley]] '16.

The Wiki records *some academic notes and some of my personal interests*. It is constructed and maintained with the great help of [[http://www.vim.org/|Vim]] + [[http://code.google.com/p/vimwiki/|Vimwiki]] + [[http://git-scm.com|Git]] and several other tools, which enable me to add something to my personal knowledge base within no more than 10 keystrokes. (And yes, no mouse needed! Check out how here: [[About]].)

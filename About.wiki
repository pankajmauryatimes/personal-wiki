This entire Wiki is maintained with several fantastic tools. The primary ones are [http://code.google.com/p/vimwiki/ Vimwiki] and [http://www.vim.org/ Vim]. Some supplementary tools those make life eaiser (or those insidiously move me toward the purely technical end...) are [http://www.dropbox.com/ Dropbox], [http://git-scm.com/ Git], and [https://github.com/ Github].

Dropbox. Dropbox enables me to crowd-store my files. Leaving important files solely in your hard drive is a dangerous decision. I lost a laptop along with tons of invaluable files once. Dropbox solves the problem.

Git and Github. Generally, after I editted an existed .wiki file or created a new one, I did the following commands to make sure Git tracks my progress and push the files to Github:

# git add . % if I created new files
# git comm 'MESSAGE' % or sometimes git comm 'MESSAGE' --amend
# git push

And boom. My files are instantaneously tracked and uploaded.

There is one major drawback with this combination of tools: Github does not correctly regonize Vimwiki format/markup. The effect is if I read my .wiki files on Github, they can look rather messy.

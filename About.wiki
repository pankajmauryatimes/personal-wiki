= About =

This entire Wiki is maintained with several fantastic tools. The primary ones are [http://code.google.com/p/vimwiki/ Vimwiki] and [http://www.vim.org/ Vim]. Some supplementary tools those make life eaiser (or those insidiously move me toward the purely technical end...) are [http://www.dropbox.com/ Dropbox], [http://git-scm.com/ Git], and `cron`.

*Dropbox & Github*. Dropbox enables me to crowd-store my files. Leaving important files solely in your hard drive is a dangerous decision. I lost a laptop along with tons of invaluable files once. Dropbox solves the problem. Github serves a similar purpose.

*Git*. Generally, after I editted an existed `.wiki` file or created a new one, I did the following commands to make sure Git tracks my progress and push to my repos:
{{{
git add .
git comm 'MESSAGE'
git push
git push dh
}}}

And boom. My files are instantaneously tracked and pushed to the repos on Github and on my dreamhost server. To actually update the `.html` files so that people can visit `me.geotakucovi.com` to view the latest version, these commands are needed:
{{{
$ mkdir /me.geotakucovi.com
$ cat > hooks/post-receive
#!/bin/sh
GIT_WORK_TREE=/me.geotakucovi.com git checkout -f
$ chmod +x hooks/post-receive
}}}

It sets up a git `post-receive` hook, and the hook will update the actual files whenever the git repo is updated. See [http://toroid.org/ams/git-website-howto Using Git to manage a web site].

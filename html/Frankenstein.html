</p>

<h3 id="toc_1.1.12">Chap 6</h3>
<p>
V at length recovered. Elizabeth and his dad were worried sick. Finally he was about to returm to Genava.
</p>

<h3 id="toc_1.1.13">Chap 7</h3>
<p>
V heard from his dad telling his brother William is murdered. When V is near home town, he saw the creature and believed it was the murderer. But when he arrived, he found people accused Justine , a poor girl their family adopted, of the crime.
</p>

<h3 id="toc_1.1.14">Chap 8</h3>
<p>

Boring monologue.
</p>

<h3 id="toc_1.1.18">Chap 12</h3>

</p>

<h3 id="toc_1.1.23">Chap 17</h3>
<p>
The creature demanded its creator to create a female equal for it, so that it would leave mankind in peace. After struggles V consented.
</p>

<h3 id="toc_1.1.24">Chap 18</h3>
<p>
Henry accompanied V on his journey to London.
</p>

<h3 id="toc_1.1.25">Chap 19</h3>

</p>

<h3 id="toc_1.1.28">Chap 22</h3>
<p>
V and E got married and started a honeymoon.
</p>

<h3 id="toc_1.1.29">Chap 23</h3>
<p>
E was viciously murdered. V's dad also died for inability to bear the tragedy. V made up his mind to revenge. The author obviously failed to render her work reasonable and self-consistent: how could a person as smart as V, who wandered beyond the classical science, hadn't seized a single chance to kill the monster? How could he be so irresolute and risk his ever happiness vanscilating? How dare him let his wife away from him at that night? If such man is what the author intended, V is a weak, powerless, blameful man.
</p>

<h3 id="toc_1.1.30">Chap 24</h3>
<p>
V began to chase the being, all the way up to the ocean where he encountered Walton. End of narration of V.

<blockquote>
we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
nothing contributes so much to tranquillize the mind as a steady purpose--a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
I have often attributed my attachment to, my passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that production of the most imaginative of modern poets.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
broken accents:
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
I once had a friend, the most noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting friendship. You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for despair. But I--I have lost everything and cannot begin life anew."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
It was the secrets of heaven and earth that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical, or in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted with their practical uses. The most learned philosopher knew little more. He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a child's blindness, added to a student's thirst for knowledge.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
I entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the philosopher's stone and the elixir of life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention. Wealth was an inferior object, but what glory would attend the discovery if I could banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death!
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
She died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
My life had hitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible repugnance to new countenances.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
mock the invisible world with its own shadows."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of Frankenstein--more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
I attended the lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the university, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive physiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
In other studies you go as far as others have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
After days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of generation and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Not that, like a magic scene, it all opened upon me at once: the information I had obtained was of a nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already accomplished.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Who shall conceive the horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless clay?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human mind.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
For this I had deprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
I figure to myself that the task of attending on your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of your poor cousin.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Before, I had only imagined the wretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and a not less terrible, disaster.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Justine died, she rested, and I was alive.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
spoke--"but is it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief? It is also a duty owed to yourself, for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment, or even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for society."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
I had an obscure feeling that all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime, which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
I, not in deed, but in effect, was the true murderer.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
I determined to go without a guide, for I was well acquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the solitary grandeur of the scene.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
For the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towards his creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before I complained of his wickedness.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"I lay on my straw, but I could not sleep. I thought of the occurrences of the day. What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people, and I longed to join them, but dared not. I remembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present I would remain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their actions.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"This trait of kindness moved me sensibly. I had been accustomed, during the night, to steal a part of their store for my own consumption, but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on the cottagers, I abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and roots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers--their grace, beauty, and delicate complexions; but how was I terrified when I viewed myself in a transparent pool! At first I started back, unable to believe that it was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
played some airs so entrancingly beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Was man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so vicious and base? He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
For a long time I could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or even why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and loathing.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken place since I awoke into life.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
despair had not yet taken possession of me; my feelings were those of rage and revenge.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
the sick impotence of despair.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
There was none among the myriads of men that existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness towards my enemies? No; from that moment I declared everlasting war against the species, and more than all, against him who had formed me and sent me forth to this insupportable misery.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
For the first time the feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to control them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I bent my mind towards injury and death.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Unfeeling, heartless creator!
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless; rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface of the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter. Oh, earth!
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
the sanguinary laws of man,
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"You must create a female for me with whom I can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being. This you alone can do, and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to concede."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Shall I respect man when he condemns me?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
His words had a strange effect upon me. I compassionated him and sometimes felt a wish to console him, but when I looked upon him, when I saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened and my feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred. I tried to stifle these sensations; I thought that as I could not sympathize with him, I had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which was yet in my power to bestow.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
He was a being formed in the "very poetry of nature."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my fellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and Justine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled my soul with anguish.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
But now I went to it in cold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Had I right, for my own benefit, to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations? I
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my promise burst upon me;
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me as their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at the price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"It is well. I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your wedding-night."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Persecuted and tortured as I am and have been, can death be any evil to me?"
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
the irresistible, disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm forgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly susceptible. Chapter
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"Man," I cried, "how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom!
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Sometimes the peasants, scared by this horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself, who feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die, left some mark to guide me.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words;
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken and overcome. I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; I abhorred myself. But when I discovered that he, the author at once of my existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for happiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the indulgence of which I was forever barred, then impotent envy and bitter indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance. I recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
You throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are consumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall. Hypocritical fiend!
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
the fallen angel becomes a malignant devil.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his friend from his door with contumely? Why do you not execrate the rustic who sought to destroy the saviour of his child?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief. My work is nearly complete. Neither yours nor any man's death is needed to consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done, but it requires my own.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and exult in the agony of the torturing flames. The light of that conflagration will fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds. My spirit will sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus. Farewell."

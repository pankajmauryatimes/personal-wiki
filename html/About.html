<h1 id="toc_1">About</h1>

<p>
This entire Wiki is maintained with several fantastic tools. The primary ones are <a href="http://code.google.com/p/vimwiki/">Vimwiki</a> and <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>. Some supplementary tools those make life eaiser (or those insidiously move me toward the purely technical end...) are <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>, <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, and <code>cron</code>.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Dropbox</strong>. Dropbox enables me to crowd-store my files. Leaving important files solely in your hard drive is a dangerous decision. I lost a laptop along with tons of invaluable files once. Dropbox solves the problem.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Git and Github</strong>. Generally, after I editted an existed .wiki file or created a new one, I did the following commands to make sure Git tracks my progress and push the files to Github:
</p>
<blockquote>
git add . % if I created new files<br />
git comm 'MESSAGE' % or sometimes git comm 'MESSAGE' --amend<br />
git push
</blockquote>

<p>
And boom. My files are instantaneously tracked and uploaded to Github. To upload them to my website server requires several slightly different commands:
</p>
<blockquote>
git add and git comm as above<br />
git push myserver<br />
(on my server) git reset --hard
</blockquote>

<p>
There are two major drawbacks with this combination of tools: 
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Github does not correctly regonize Vimwiki format/markup. The effect is if I read my .wiki files on Github, they can look rather messy.
</li>
<li>
<del>The manipulation seems tedious. As my knowledge of Git and Linux accumulate, I expect a more elegant solution in the future.</del> 
</li>
<ul>
<li>
(<strong>OBSOLETE</strong>) Solution: run <code>ssh user@domain.com ./git</code> directly in my Git Bash, and the nice little shell script <code>git</code> I wrote does the <code>cd</code> and <code>reset --hard</code> stuff.
</li>
</ul>
</ol>

<p>
Oct 22, 2011 <strong>Update</strong>: There's a better solution than the above: ask <strong>cron</strong> to run <code>./git</code> command every 10 minutes. Life saved.

This entire Wiki is maintained with several fantastic tools. The primary ones are <a href="http://code.google.com/p/vimwiki/">Vimwiki</a> and <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>. Some supplementary tools those make life eaiser (or those insidiously move me toward the purely technical end...) are <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>, <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>.
</p>

<p>
Dropbox. Dropbox enables me to crowd-store my files. Leaving important files solely in your hard drive is a dangerous decision. I lost a laptop along with tons of invaluable files once. Dropbox solves the problem.
</p>

<p>
Git and Github. Generally, after I editted an existed .wiki file or created a new one, I did the following commands to make sure Git tracks my progress and push the files to Github:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
git add . % if I created new files
</li>
<li>
git comm 'MESSAGE' % or sometimes git comm 'MESSAGE' --amend
</li>
<li>
git push
</li>
</ol>

<p>
And boom. My files are instantaneously tracked and uploaded to Github. To upload them to my website server requires several slightly different commands:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
git add and git comm as above
</li>
<li>
git push myserver master
</li>
<li>
(on my server) git reset --hard
</li>
</ol>

<p>
There are two major drawbacks with this combination of tools: 
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Github does not correctly regonize Vimwiki format/markup. The effect is if I read my .wiki files on Github, they can look rather messy.
</li>
<li>
The manipulation seems tedious. As my knowledge of Git and Linux accumulate, I expect a more elegant solution in the future.
</li>
</ol>

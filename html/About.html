This entire Wiki is maintained with several fantastic tools. The primary ones are <a href="http://code.google.com/p/vimwiki/">Vimwiki</a> and <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>. Some supplementary tools those make life eaiser (or those insidiously move me toward the purely technical end...) are <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>, <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>.

Dropbox enables me to crowd-store my files. Leaving important files solely in your hard drive is a dangerous decision. I lost a laptop along with tons of invaluable files once. Dropbox solves the problem.

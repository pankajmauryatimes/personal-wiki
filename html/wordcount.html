<h1 id="toc_1">wordcount.py and Some Interesting Results</h1>
<p>
<code>wordcount.py</code> is a tiny Python program I wrote for fun, that counted the most frequent words in an article and their occurances. It supports arbitrary number of most frequent words.
</p>

<p>
The code, along with some sample results, can be found here: [<a href="https://github.com/concretevitamin/wordcount">https://github.com/concretevitamin/wordcount</a> Github].
</p>

<h2 id="toc_1.1">Some Interesting Results</h2>

<p>
I selected two quite personal pieces to examine their 15 most frequent words:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Such, Such were the Joys</em>, by George Orwell

<li>
<em>Once More to the Lake</em>, by E. B. White

</ul>

<p>
The results are shockingly similar, since they are both so personal.
</p>

<p>
Joy:
</p>
<pre>
i 474          my 130         you 129
me 90          one 89         â€” 77
he 76          his 63         did 61
could 59       even 56        we 55
who 50         any 47         your 47
</pre>

<p>
Lake:
</p>
<pre>
i 35           we 20          you 16
my 15          lake 14        up 14
been 13        one 12         out 11
they 10        his 10         over 9
their 9        same 9         he 9
</pre>
<p>
<br />
</p>

<p>
Now, <em>The Ring of Time</em>, anoter piece by E. B. White, which is not as personal as Lake:
</p>
<pre>
her 30         she 29         i 18
one 11         horse 10       ring 7
we 7           time 7         out 6
his 6          around 6       circus 6
woman 5        two 5          girl 5
</pre>
<p>
The most frequent words here change to "her" and "she", which refers to the girl. Also notice the most important objects being portrayed in the article: <strong>circus, horse, time, ring, woman, girl.</strong>
<br /><br />
</p>

<p>
Let's check out the famous <em>I Have a Dream</em>:
</p>
<pre>
we 29          freedom 19     our 17
i 15           let 13         negro 13
one 12         every 10       day 10
come 10        go 9           dream 9
ring 9         their 8        able 8
</pre>
<p>
Some difference, but not huge. Now the 25 most frequent words:
</p>
<pre>
we 29          freedom 19     our 17
i 15           let 13         negro 13
one 12         every 10       day 10
come 10        go 9           dream 9
ring 9         their 8        able 8
back 8         you 8          nation 7
satisfied 6    white 6        cannot 6
long 6         new 5          great 5
my 5           
</pre>
<p>
Huge difference from all other three articles!

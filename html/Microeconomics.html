<h1 id="toc_1">Uncategorized</h1>
<ul>
<li>
comparative advantage: the one who has smaller opportunity cost of one product

<li>
returns to scale: refers to changes in output resulting from a proportional change in all inputs (where all inputs increase by a constant factor).

<li>
Demand curves for private goods are added <strong>horizontally</strong>; whereas those for public goods are added <strong>vertically</strong>.

<li>
cross-price elasticity = %d(quantity demanded of X) / %d(price of Y).

<ul>
<li>
&lt; 0, compliments; &gt; 0, substitutes.

</ul>
<li>
Defining characteristic of a capitalistic economy: private ownership &amp; protection of property rights.

<li>
progressive tax: more tax on richer, redistribute income; regressive: more tax on poor.

<li>
Opportunity cost of STH = direct price of STH + implicit cost

<li>
The substitution effect is when the price of one good rises, and the consumer buys more of the cheaper good.

<li>
The income effect is when the consumer cuts back on all goods, not simply the good that has become more expensive.

<li>
estate and gift taxes: if these taxes are high, they help achieve greater income equality.

</ul>

<h1 id="toc_2">Efficiency</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>efficiency in production</strong>: MP_k / r = MP_l / w (MP = marginal product).

<li>
<strong>distributive efficiency</strong> (maximizing utility): Price_1 / Price_2 = MU_1 / MU_2 (MU = marginal utility)

<ul>
<li>
MU_1 / MU_2 -&gt; marginal rate of substitution (MRS)

<li>
formal condition: MRS are equal for every consumer.

</ul>
<li>
<strong>allocative efficiency</strong>: P = MC (long run perfect competition).

<li>
<strong>productive efficiency</strong>: P = minATC

</ul>
  
<h1 id="toc_3">Laws</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>law of diminishing marginal utility (short run)</strong>: decreasing satisfaction gained from additional units of a good consumed in a given period.

<li>
law of demand; law of supply.

<li>
marginal cost will increase as the production expands (supply)

<li>
law of diminishing marginal product (consider the MP curve): first increase at increasing rate, then increase at decreasing rate, then decrease.

</ul>

<h1 id="toc_4">Demand and Supply</h1>
<p>
<strong>Reasons behind shift of demand curve</strong>:<br />
<strong>TRIBE</strong>: <strong>Taste</strong> of consumers; prices of <strong>Related</strong> goods (substitutes and complements); <strong>Income</strong> of buyers; number of <strong>Buyers</strong>; <strong>Expectations</strong> for the future.<br />
</p>

<p>
<strong>Reasons behind rightward shift of supply curve</strong>: anything that leads to more units of the good being produced at any given price.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
decrease in input costs; improv. in tech.; expectations of lower prices in the future; increase in sellers; 

<li>
decrease in the price of a "substitue in production" (milk &amp; cheese)

<li>
increase in the price of a "joint product" (leather &amp; beef)<br />

</ul>

<p>
<code>*</code> if demand and supply shift together, one of eq. price &amp; eq. quantity will be certain, the other depends (sometimes indeterminant)
</p>

<p>
<strong>Price Ceiling</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
to have effect, must below eq. price

<li>
may cause (1) queuing cost; (2) black market.

</ul>

<p>
<strong>Price Floor</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
to have effect, must above eq. price

<li>
Example: minimum rage; some workers benefit, others are hurt

</ul>

<h1 id="toc_5">Costs, Production, Supply</h1>
<ul>
<li>
Values of a large-size firm: (1) hire more experts (2) spread over fixed costs over large outputs (3) economies of scale

<li>
Excess capacity exists whenever firms/markets don't operate at socially optimal level (P = MC).

<li>
PPF

<ul>
<li>
If resources are substitutable, PPF would be a straight line.

<li>
Straght PPF implies no specialization; Curved PPF implies specialization.

</ul>
</ul>

<h1 id="toc_6">Perfect Competition</h1>
<ul>
<li>
In LR: P = MR = MC = min ATC; zero profits.

<li>
In SR: only P = MR.

<li>
When <code>P &gt; AVC</code>, continue production. When <code>MR &gt; MC</code>, increase production.

<li>
MC curve is actually the firm's supply curve (representing at each price the quantity the firm is willing to supply).

<li>
In SR: Since P = MC and if P &lt; AVC then firm will shut down, in SR the supply curve is actually the MC curve above the AVC.

<li>
In LR: the supply curve is actually the MC curve above the ATC.

<li>
<strong>Demand increase</strong> -&gt; firms enter -&gt; supply increase -&gt; <strong>price returns to original</strong>, quantity supplied by industry increases; whereas quantity supplied by individual firm remains the same

<li>
Reasons that ATC is U-shaped: spreading total fixed cost over a larger output + eventually diminishing returns.

</ul>

<h1 id="toc_7">Monopoly</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>monopoly pricing power (control over prices; market power)</strong>: P &gt; MC; pricing strategy: P &gt; MR.

<li>
break even = zero profits = fair return price.

<li>
socially optimal price = P = MC.

<li>
shut-down (short-run): P &lt; AVC. exit (long run): P &lt; ATC.

<li>
Reasons that price discrimination occurs:

<ol>
<li>
control over prices

<li>
seperated buyers of differing price elasticities

<li>
can prevent re-saling among buyers

</ol>
<li>
<a href="comparison between monoplies.html">comparison between monoplies</a>

</ul>

<h1 id="toc_8">Monopolistic Competition</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="Mono. Comp. in LR.html">Mono. Comp. in LR</a>; LR normal profit.

<li>
economic profit in SR.

</ul>

<h1 id="toc_9">Oligopoly</h1>
<ul>
<li>
Cartel model: all the firms in the industry act in unison to set a monopoly price; e.g. OPEC.

</ul>

<h1 id="toc_10">Resource Markets with Applications to Labor</h1>
<ul>
<li>
MFC (marginal factor cost; supply S = MFC when in perfect competition) = MRC (marginal revenue cost)

<li>
<strong>MRP (marginal revenue product; demand D = MRP = MP marginal product times P price) = MRC</strong> is an analogy to <strong>MR = MC</strong>. If MRP &gt; MRC, continue to hire additional units of labor.

<li>
wage elasticity of demand (= %d(quantity demanded of labor) / %d(wage rate))

<ol>
<li>
The higher the price elasticity of demand for the product, the higher the wage elasticity of demand.

<li>
The higher the proportion of labor costs relative to total costs of production, the higher will be the wage elasticity of demand.

<li>
The greater the number of substitute resources available and the degree to which they are substitutable, the higher will be the wage elasticity of demand.

</ol>
<li>
<strong>perfectly competitive resource (labor) market</strong>

<ul>
<li>
wage rate constant

</ul>
<li>
<strong>imperfectly competitive resource (labor) market (monopsony)</strong>

<ul>
<li>
compared to perfect market, wage rate and units of labor are both lowered

</ul>
<li>
cost minimization: MPP_L / MRC_L = MPP_K / MRC_K (L = labor; K = capital), or MPP_L / P_L = MPP_K / P_K in perfect competition.

<li>
profit maximization: MRP_L / MRC_L = MRP_K / MRC_K = 1, or MRP_L / P_L = MRP_K / P_K = 1 in perfect competition.

<li>
If price of product increase, only demand for such labor increase.

</ul>

<h1 id="toc_11">Profit, Price</h1>
<ul>
<li>
accounting profit: does not count opportunity cost (implicit cost); economic profit: counts.

<ul>
<li>
i.e. economic profit = accounting profit - opportunity cost

</ul>
<li>
All types of market maximize <strong>profits</strong> by producing where MR = MC.

<li>
All types of market maximize <strong>revenue</strong> by producing at MR = 0.

</ul>

<h1 id="toc_12">Public Goods, Externality</h1>
<ul>
<li>
public goods: nonrival in consumption, nonexcludability

<li>
MSC = MEC + MPC.

<li>
Positive externalities will improve efficiency when MC &lt; MB.

<li>
Pos Ext: producer produces more than socially efficient level

<li>

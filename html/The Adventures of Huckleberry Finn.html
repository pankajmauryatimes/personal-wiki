</p>

<h4 id="toc_1.0.0.22">chap the last.</h4>
<p>
chap the last. the end of the story... but their adventures were about to continue... huck's dad seemed dead... the book in general is narrated in a optmistic tone, it includes so many social descriptions of that time's america: slavery, goodwill vs. bad, and the author seems to advocate good nature and equality of blacks, conveyed through vivid and unbounded thoughts of these two kids and jim himself. the book can be amounted to "american spirit" and "american dreams". nice book to read, classics do worth of their reputation, funny adventures!

 It most killed Jim a-laughing.  He was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was, anyway.

<blockquote>
I went to sleep, and Jim didn't call me when it was my turn.  He often done that.  When I waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with his head down betwixt his knees, moaning and mourning to himself.  I didn't take notice nor let on.  I knowed what it was about.  He was thinking about his wife and his children, away up yonder, and he was low and homesick; because he hadn't ever been away from home before in his life; and I do believe he cared just as much for his people as white folks does for their'n.  It don't seem natural, but I reckon it's so.  He was often moaning and mourning that way nights, when he judged I was asleep, and saying, "Po' little 'Lizabeth! po' little Johnny! it's mighty hard; I spec' I ain't ever gwyne to see you no mo', no mo'!"  He was a mighty good nigger, Jim was. But this time I somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young ones; and by and by he says:

sly?—now how do I know whether to write to Mary Jane or not? S'pose she dug him up and didn't find nothing, what would she think of me? Blame it, I says, I might get hunted up and jailed; I'd better lay low and keep dark, and not write at all; the thing's awful mixed now; trying to better it, I've worsened it a hundred times, and I wish to goodness I'd just let it alone, dad fetch the whole business!

    Them poor things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them getting fooled and lied to so, but I didn't see no safe way for me to chip in and change the general tune.

 nigger traders come along, and the king sold them the niggers reasonable, for three-day drafts as they called it, and away they went, the two sons up the river to Memphis, and their mother down the river to Orleans.  I thought them poor girls and them niggers would break their hearts for grief; they cried around each other, and took on so it most made me down sick to see it.  The girls said they hadn't ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold away from the town.  I can't ever get it out of my

 It made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by herself in the night, and them devils laying there right under her own roof, shaming her and robbing her; and when I folded it up and give it to her I see the water come into her eyes, too; and she shook me by the hand, hard, and says:

astraddle of a rail—that is, I knowed it WAS the king and the duke, though they was all over tar and feathers, and didn't look like nothing in the world that was human—just looked like a couple of monstrous big soldier-plumes.  Well, it made me sick to see it; and I was sorry for them poor pitiful rascals, it seemed like I couldn't ever feel any hardness against them any more in the world.  It was a dreadful thing to see.  Human beings CAN be awful cruel to one another.

That's all he said, and that's all I said.  It warn't no use to say any more; because when he said he'd do a thing, he always done it.

<blockquote>
"What do we want of a shirt, Tom?" "Want it for Jim to keep a journal on." "Journal your granny—JIM can't write."

<blockquote>
"Well, then, what'll we make him the ink out of?" "Many makes it out of iron-rust and tears; but that's the common sort and women; the best authorities uses their own blood.  Jim can do that; and when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message to let the world know where he's captivated, he can write it on the bottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window.  The Iron Mask always done that, and it's a blame' good way, too."

"NOW you're TALKING!"  I says; "your head gets leveler and leveler all the time, Tom Sawyer," I says.  "Picks is the thing, moral or no moral; and as for me, I don't care shucks for the morality of it, nohow.  When I start in to steal a nigger, or a watermelon, or a Sunday-school book, I ain't no ways particular how it's done so it's done.  What I want is my nigger; or what I want is my watermelon; or what I want is my Sunday- school book; and if a pick's the handiest thing, that's the thing I'm a- going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that Sunday-school book out with; and I don't give a dead rat what the authorities thinks about it

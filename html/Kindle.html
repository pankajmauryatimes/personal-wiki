<h1 id="toc_1">Kindle</h1>

<p>
Kindle is the best trade I've ever made. You should be green (too). :)
</p>

<h2 id="toc_1.1">The Advantages of Kindle</h2>
<ul>
<li>
You can easily search for a word or a sentence within the book, a function I found extremely useful when reading big books like <a href="A Song of Ice and Fire.html">A Song of Ice and Fire</a> series.

</ul>

<h2 id="toc_1.2">The Order</h2>
<p>
I possess a Kindle 3, Black, Wi-fi only. It was ordered directly from amazon.com and delivered to Hong Kong, where Jiu Mei's mom works. I received my Kindle in mid-Jan.
</p>

<p>
In total, the order costs me less than 1100 rmb.
</p>

<h2 id="toc_1.3">Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Duokan System is okay, but I think Kindle 3 only satisfies readers reading <a href="Reading.html">Literature</a> in mobi. If you want to read pdf's, go to Kindle DXG or other devices.

<li>
I found Kindle extremely suitbale for learning math textbooks. Because you don't need too much space for viewing; you just read a small piece, think, and learn.

</ul>

path difference equals (n + 1/2) * wavelength:
2t = (n + 1/2) * lamda
where
t: thickness of the film
lamda: wavelength in the film

Notice that only reflected rays undergo a 180 degree phase change; refracted ones do not.


    * If both reflections occur at interfaces of less/more, then both are inverted and their net phase difference is zero.
    * If both reflections occur at interfaces of more/less, then neither is inverted and the net phase difference between them is zero.
    * However, if one reflection occurs at less/more and the other at more/less, then there is a net phase difference between the reflections of ½ λ.
    
   less: small index of refraction (n) 

Generally,
n_1

n_2

n_3

where n_1 &lt; n_2 &gt; n_3 (if n_1 &lt; n_2 &lt; n_3, no phase change will occur).

The rule is shown to be true by using the product rule for derivatives and the fundamental theorem of calculus. Thus

    \begin{align} f(b)g(b) - f(a)g(a) & = \int_a^b \frac{d}{dx} ( f(x) g(x) )\, dx \\ & = \int_a^b f'(x) g(x) \, dx + \int_a^b f(x) g'(x)\, dx. \end{align}

In the traditional calculus curriculum, the rule is often stated using indefinite integrals in the form

    \int f(x) g'(x)\, dx = f(x) g(x) - \int f'(x) g(x)\, dx\!

or, if u = f(x), v = g(x) and the differentials du = f ′(x) dx and dv = g′(x) dx, then it is in the form most often seen:

    \int u\, dv=uv-\int v\, du.\! 
    \int u\, dv=uv-\int v\, du.\!

This formula can be interpreted to mean that the area under the graph of a function u(v) is the same as the area of the rectangle u v minus the area above the graph.

indefinite integral form.

= NOTE: This page contains serious Spoilers! =

Until I finished reading the last thought of Bran before he fled from Winterfell, I didn’t realize it was also the last sentence of this book. This is because I read the book on my [[Kindle]], and the Kindle then said I was at 96% of the book – I discovered the other 4% were the Appendixes.

So, Winter has come – this is the thing I’d like to say most at this messy moment. I’d like to note down some particular moments in the book here, and share some of my favorite quotes.

*The demise of Maester Luwin in the last chapter is one of the most touching moments.* Being a non-careful reader and a foreigner, I can’t tell how he ends up in the godswood. But the thing is, his dying in the place where Ned – the symbol, head, power of the House – used to seek calm again tells his absolute loyalty to Winterfell and the Starks. And of course, it is so sad. The dying old man for the last time guiding two high-born, vulnerable kids adds to the sadness. Indeed, House Stark has been falling throughout, yet, no any other moments or events – not the demise of Ned Stark, not the separation of the family – could be as sad and symbolic as this. 

But I also believe that George Martin does not mean to destroy the Starks for *1)* the last sentence of the book is “I’m not dead either” which is Bran’s as well as all Starks’ brave proclamation, *2)* Starks are kind of the “protagonists” of the series because *a)* they have the unusual, mystic, powerful direwolves and *b)* the bastard of House Stark, Jon, has begun his noble Infernal Affair (_Chinese allusion here! Refer to the movie series._) for the whole realm and *c)* They are so principled, “nobler” than any of the other Houses.

But something shocked me. I just opened the page (http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Stark) and it says the Heir to the House is Arya Stark. Does that mean all three boys die in the following books? I don’t think there’s a second answer…
Back to the Starks. Clearly neither Bran nor Rickon is strong enough to live. Recall one of my favorite quotes, which is Bran’s thought in the last chapter: When a man was hurt you took him to the maester, but what could you do when your maester was hurt? So innocent and helpless a boy. Not to mention Rickon; recall that when the brothers split he clung to Hodor’s leg.

This post here (http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/55457-most-surprising-moment-of-the-series-so-far/) inspired me to note down *some of the most shocking moments here*. First, I’ll go with the sudden defeat of Stannis. Stannis had much larger host than King’s Landing’s, yet the unexpected, sudden arrival of Lord Tywin changed everything. I really don’t know, just as the Imp didn’t, how the hell Tywin showed up. Poor Baratheons… So up to now, the only Baratheon blood left in the world will be Robert’s Bastard’s. And there are no such persons who can be called the Rightful King. I wonder what role the Red Priestess will play from now on (according to the Wiki, she will continue to show up all up to the latest book, A Dance with Dragons).

Another shock will be Jon being forced to join the wildings. Mighty course. And I can only hope he does well and goes back to the Watch eventually. I have no hope that the Watch can hold the attack.

Finally… Tips (or Lesson Learned): *the Table of Contents tells a lot.* Be sure to share your favorite moments and quotes. :)

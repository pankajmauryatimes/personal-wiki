== Selecting regularization parameter, lambda ==
Define:<br>
J = the original cost function with regularization penalty term, used in training;<br>
J_train = J_CV = J_test = cost function, used as `errors'.<br>

Selection process:
{{{Try different values of lambda and by minimizing J we obtain a set of optimal thetas, each corresponding to each lambda value.
Try each optimal theta, select the one that minimizes J_CV. Thus, we obtain theta and lambda for our model.
J_CV is an appropriate estimate for J_test.

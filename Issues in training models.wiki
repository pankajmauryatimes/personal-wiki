= Selecting regularization parameter \lambda =

Define:
J_train = the original cost function + regularization penalty term
J_CV = J_test = original cost function

Try different values of lambda and by minimizing J_train we obtain a set of optimal thetas, each corresponding to each lambda value.
Try each optimal theta, select the one that minimizes J_CV. Thus, we obtain theta and lambda for our model.
J_CV is an appropriate estimate for J_test.

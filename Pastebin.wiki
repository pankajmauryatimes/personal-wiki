[22:51:14] <ConcreteVitamin> Is there a way to quickly switch between tags in a help file? (e.g. using tab to focus next element in a webpage)
[22:56:38] <scandal> you can sort of fake it by searching for \*.*\*  .  not sure if there is a better way

[23:02:20] <SuperG1134> Hi
[23:03:21] <jerojasro> those mappings let you: hit enter over a tag name, jump to it. Use J and K to jump to next/previous tag in a help file

[11:22:45] <Araxia> Axioplase: :help g:vimwiki_valid_html_tags
[11:23:19] <Axioplase> ha.
[11:23:23] <Araxia> i think if you add to that, you've got what you want.
[11:24:24] <Araxia> yup. works.


[11:29:02] <ConcreteVitamin> Every time I finish converting, A-Tab to Filezilla and select all the html files, and then Alt-Down to upload
[11:29:06] <Araxia> i used an svn server. i just set the mime types to text/html and checked them in and boom, instant website.

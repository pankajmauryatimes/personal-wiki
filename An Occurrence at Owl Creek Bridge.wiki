After civil war:
- Regionalism
- Realism
- Naturalism
- Psychological Novel
- Ironists

= An Occurence at Owl Creek Bridge =
- Bierce: a cynic; fought in Civil War.
- In Romantic novels, bravery was normally rewarded. But in this passage, the man dies for nothing.

* Point of View *
- changes
- Part I: objective. Part II: omniscient. Part III: limited.
    

== Part II == 
use omniscient to show: 
- reasons behind execution
- personality & background of the protagonist

- "without too much qualification assented to at least a part of the frankly villainous dictum that all is fair in love and war."
=== Reasons ===
# the bridge is important 
# be hanged immediately if they interfere

- The description shows sympathy towards the man.
- "The sentinels, facing the banks of the stream, might have been statues to adorn the bridge. "
    - "motionless", "stonily"
    - suggests that they are inhuman, cold-blooded.
- Then the author describes the man. Full details, kind-featured; ***A strong contrast***.
    - to show the man is noble, human
    - to show ***sympathy*** (even though he's a southerner)
- He is a slave owner. Therefore, he supports the South and fights against the North.

== Part III ==
use limited to describe the man's thoughts, in details

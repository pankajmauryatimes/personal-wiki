=== Quicksort in Haskell... ===
{{{
quicksort' :: (Ord a) => [a] -> [a]
quicksort' [] = []
quicksort' (x:xs) =
    let bigger = quicksort' (filter (>x) xs)
        smaller = quicksort' (filter (<=x) xs)
    in  bigger ++ [x] ++ smaller
}}}
I had these three words to say when I saw the above: OH. MY. GOD.

=== Fibonacci, the Hello World in Haskell ===
{{{
fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)

-- or
fibs = 0 : scanl (+) 1 fibs
}}}
How elegant is that.

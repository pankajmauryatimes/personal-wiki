= Problem =

Nine mathematicians met together, and found that for every three of them, at least two could talk in one language they knew. Given that each mathematician could speak at most 3 languages, prove: at least three could talk in one language they knew.

= A Simple Generalization =

N mathematicians met together, and found that for every three of them, at least two could talk in one language they knew. Given that each mathematician could speak at most C languages, prove: at least three could talk in one language they knew.

= The sufficient and necessary condition =
\begin{align}
N - 1 & \geq 2C \quad and \\
\lceil \frac{N - 2}{2} \rceil & > C.
\end{align}

= Kindle =

Kindle is the best trade I've ever made. You should be green (too). :)

== The Advantages of Kindle ==
* You can easily search for a word or a sentence within the book, a function I found extremely useful when reading big books like [[A Song of Ice and Fire]] series.

== The Order ==
I possess a Kindle 3, Black, Wi-fi only. It was ordered directly from amazon.com and delivered to Hong Kong, where Jiu Mei's mom works. I received my Kindle in mid-Jan.

In total, the order costs me less than 1100 rmb.

== Notes ==
* Duokan System is okay, but I think Kindle 3 only satisfies readers reading [[Reading|Literature]] in mobi. If you want to read pdf's, go to Kindle DXG or other devices.
* I found Kindle extremely suitbale for learning math textbooks. Because you don't need too much space for viewing; you just read a small piece, think, and learn.
